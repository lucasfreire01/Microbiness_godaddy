# Microbiness_godaddy
The goal is to predict the monthly microbusiness density in a given area. 
For that we have 4 datasets: train, reveled, test, and census all datasets are passed by preprocessing and then consented for that model to have a better score 
finallytesting some models and see what was best so we took the RandomFlorestRegressor for training the data and the score was 99.38 the difference between 
prediction and original data was in mean 0.008.
